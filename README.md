# BulletinBoard
Repository for the implementation of the Bulletin Board programming style made in scala.
To run the project, simply run the project in a sbt shell. If you wish to use your own text,
simply add the file to the src files and in Main.scala change the text to be used (line 3). 
Alternatively, you can make changes directly in the bigtext.txt file.
